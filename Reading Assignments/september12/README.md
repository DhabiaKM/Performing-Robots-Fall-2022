# Robots: Asleep, Awake, Alone, and in Love

The robot case that intruiged me the most in this chapter was “Fish—Bird”. The naming of the two “lovers” was a bit ironic to me and fish swim and birds fly and they almost never exist in the same space except when birds eat fish and when fish eat birds. Besides that, the fact that they are cubes and wheelchairs makes them more human. I have never heard of anything like this before but somehow the dance and interactions that they do simply make sense to me. 

A robot that was not mentioned in the reading but is still one of my favorite robots is PARO. This robot also was not made for creating physical things or production lines, but rather it was created to inspire a sense of comfort and safety. This video demostarates PARO’s functionalities:

It’s so interesting that the charging cable is a pacifier. This robot was made to build a relationship with its interactor. It knows what interactions are negative (hitting) and what are positive (pets and cuddles). I am not sure where the future of robot pets and service animals lies, but this is a good starting point for research.

**Questions/Future thoughts:** 

- What emotions are robots able to perpetuate without scaring audiences?
- Is more complex really better, or are robots with simpler mechanics more successful and granting the audience their purpose?
