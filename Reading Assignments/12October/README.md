# Reading Response

- What do robots have to do with stage plays?
- What do performing robots, cast as themselves on stage say about human nature?

**Human and the Robotic Other**

- What happens when we’re challanged as a species?
    - We’re no longer the only ones that can beat eachother at a board game, there’s now a challenger. Someone else that can also play chess, and claim the victory for that “other”.

**Machines Who Think**

- What does it mean to be?
- “I think there for I am” → Robots think therefore they are?
- Artifact to lifeform → Can the robot become a human? Robots as human kin.

The robot is no longer a fantasy. 

- In what ways can including robots playing themselves in theatrical peprformances affect the drama and feelings that the play delivers.

**Posthumanist Responses → Try it!** 

- Interrogate, acknowledge and affirm the robot as puppet agent

What can robots teach us about being humans? 

**Robots in Plays** 

- These robots challenge what it means to be human

**Question** 

- How much does mimesis matter in the believeability of a play?
- What parts do the human actors play in this “believability”?

The way the other humans interacted with Geminoid F made her so much more believable. 

- Collective Instinct → naturally programmed, realistic reactions, make humans more likely to empathize?
- “It would be no good for a robot to be, for example, just a cup or kettle because this would make it difficult to read human-like emotions” → Is this true? How much do you believe this? Why would we not be able to empathize with a tea cut robot that expresses emotions differently?

**Binocular Vision** 

- Granting things vision through
    1. Real
    2. Imaginry
- If you think, you believe, then it is true.
- Something may not be true, but once you see it, you start thinking of it, the possibility becomes likely and eventually the illusion sets in and android Ikumi is now kin to the other bioological human sisters.

**The Importance of Character**

- Character can make us prefer the unnatural
- Audiences like android Ikumi more than human Ikumi because she is more organic, sociable and warm, whereas human Ikumi is a recluse and is more “mechanical” and less relatable.
- “How is it possible to feel more empathy for an android than a human, particularily when that android is performed by a mechanical puppet?”
- Android Ikumi shared expereinces in her brain that happened to human Ikumi way before she was even made. Can our experiences be carried on by android versions of ourseleves? Are we human anymore as we have the ability to project ourseleves onto devices that can carry our voices long after we go?
- “We are not empaths in the sense that we are trained to respond to specific stimuli accordingly, we ourselves are machines in a constant feedback loop with the world around us.”
- Robots and humans are equally formed by two things: environments and physicality.
