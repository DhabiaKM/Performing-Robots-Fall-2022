# On Stage: Robots as Performers 

This reading was an interesting introduction to a new topic, HRI. 

The most interesting ideas discussed: 

<ol>
  <li>Performance as a space for experimentation of HRI.</li>
  <li>The controlled environment that the stage provides.</li>
  <li>Scenes as sequences of beats which manage to have enough flexiblity within them.</li>
  <li>The robots given some agency (are not fully controlled).</li>
  <li>Musical Robots:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Robotic musical instruments.</li>
    <li>Anthromorphic musical robots that imitate human artists.</li>
  </ol>
