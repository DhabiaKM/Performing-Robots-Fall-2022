**Digital Actors:** 

- Digital Puppets
- Video Actors
- Mechanical Actors

## Digital Puppets

---

- Puppets and onscreen “robots”
- Can take any form and shape — also called animated chatacters, avatars, and digibodies.
- Usually a controllable tool, projections on a screen controlled by a performer.
- How is the body represented within the virtual space? Should we actively police this, since the whole point of having virtual spaces is freedom from the constraining physical limitations the body experiences in real life.

**Some Examples Mentioned + My Thoughts:** 

- Dinosarus - Mark Reany
    - Actors were mimicking the projections, and matching their speeds to the speed of the 3D models’ rendering speed.
- The Magic Flute
- The Skriker
- Blue Bloodshot Flowers

## Video Actors

---

- Doubling the actor on stage with his own image.
- Using real time videos to create images and videos of the actors that can be manipulated.

**Some Examples Mentioned + My Thoughts:** 

- Continuos City

**Vtubers** 

- I feel like vtubers are good examples of video actors.

## Mechanical Actors

---

- Cold metal form and flesh working togethering.
- robot → originates from R.U.R. play
- displaying natural-seeming behaviour instead of eliciting human reactions → I love this idea a lot, it makes me think of last week’s presentation and reading discussion when we were talking about the aesthetics and how expressiveness can beat realism.
- The importance of eye-contact — does it really matter?

**Some Examples Mentioned + My Thoughts:** 

- Baxter, the Robot Actor
- YOU n.0
- Anthromporphizing
- Comedia Robotica
- Robots in Midsummer Night’s Dream
