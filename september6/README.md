# Robots and Communication (NOT DONE) 

In the paper, the authors present a project of performing agents, called Woggles. 

I think it was really interesting to read about the developments that these authors were working on. This paper was written about 3 decades ago, before the widespread. 

In the paper, the authors discussed the different types of interactions and communication that can happen between the agents (the robots), the performers and the audience. This made me wonder, have these authors considered what happens when the only method of communication that occurs is between the audience and the agent. This removal of the performer, which in this case is the agent itself, creates an interesting dilemma for the creator of such agents. What happens when the agent is left to interact with the audience. This is a very common occurance nowadays but I researched the first occurances of such performances and came across toys. Toys are perfect agents for experimenting with robots as performers. Their main purpose is to entertain and amuse.
